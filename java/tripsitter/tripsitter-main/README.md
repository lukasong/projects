# tripsitter
personal project to manage my music (from youtube playlist) and copy to clipboard for vrchat while im in vr

if u need to use this compilsed send me a dm on discord if not pls dont reuse code, attributions soon but this is not really a public project more here for just storing the code so i didnt bother making a pretty readme.

"trip" refers to me being on adventure gaming in vr and not wanting to take it off to get a new youtube url to copy my music. "sitter" implies something or someone watching and taking care of me. this lil java thing solves that issue :)
