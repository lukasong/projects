The latest version of MAE is now almost 4 years old!! I can't believe people are still using it.. should I be honored or scared? Haha! Check out my new MAE replacement shader at [my website](https://www.luka.moe/june) called June which is constantly up-to-date for VRChat, completely rewritten, and just wow, much better lol.

# mae
Luka MAE is a screen  effects (fx) shader for VRChat. 

# this repo
Luka MAE Shader (v11 and v12) for Unity and VRChat. V0-V10 are not uploaded because they are even older and are some of the first shaders I made, and I encourage nobody to use or learn from that code.

This is just a code demo, and is not to be republished anywhere (including your Unity or in VRChat). VRChat will be contacted about taking down avatars with it. To purchase a license legally, please message me on Discord @ luka#8375.
