There are two versions of the shader, and there are two variations of each version. In this package, you will find:
- luka/randoms/Fire/Toon
- luka/randoms/Fire/Toon Stencil
- luka/randoms/Fire/Real
- luka/randoms/Fire/Real Stencil

The stencil variations allow to be hidden around objects, such as a candle, to prevent over-rendering or clipping. To set these shaders up, please see the prefabs in the Resources folder. The shaders will work on a single plane, or single particle, but the prefab comes with a second particle system for ashes that can be removed. If you are making a new material using them for scratch, I suggest using the provided maps in the Resources folder as well!

Thank you for using my work! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I did creating it c:
