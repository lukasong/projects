ATTRIBUTIONS:
- TechDev (https://github.com/TechDevOnGitHub) helped me a lot with getting the texture-to-kernel sample working properly.

YOU MAY NOT:
- Redistribute the code alone (example: hosting the package on your own website).
- Take credit for the code that you did not have a role in.
- If redistributing, specifically commercially, attribution is appreciated.

YOU MAY:
- Use the package in transformative works, either for personal use or commercial use.
- Edit the code to your liking so long as any changes are noted if being redistributed.

Thank you for using my work! I hope you enjoy using it as much as I did creating it c:
