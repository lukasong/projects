# Editing
To edit/make your own version, you will need [Discord RPC](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/releases), or you can use the one packaged into the release zip. If you are new to working with BeatSaber, I'd recommend reading [this](https://pastebin.com/raw/Md5VLALp) (but use 4.6 instead of 3.5 target framework).


# Credits
Thanks to [Xyonico's](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberDiscordPresence) original BeatSaber Discord Presence mod that inspired me to make this! It hasn't been updated in a while, and I love Discord RP, so I decided to make my own version based upon theirs.


# Final Note
Problems, suggestions, should I remove something, request, or just want to yell at me about how bad my code is? Or if you have trouble installing or using? You can message me anytime on Discord at **luka#8375**
