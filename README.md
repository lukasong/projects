Random smol projects that don't warrant their own repo.. probably nothing useful.. just for my own sake. mostly random shaders and web files. for my bigger, "real" projects, check out [this!](http://www.luka.moe/projects). **Please note that this repository does not account for all of my projects - many of them are are private and not even listed as closed-source.** And hey, thank you for reading and checking it out! c:

# Actively Maintained Projects ‚õàÔ∏è
- [June Post-Processing Suite](http://www.luka.moe/june) **(shader)**: a custom post-processing suite with over 100 effects for VRChat and Unity, a custom UI, a custom shader pre-processor, and more.
- [MagicBounce AI Upscaler](http://www.luka.moe/magicbounce) **(csharp)**: a Unity window that allows you to batch upscale (using machine learning through the Barracuda library), compress, edit, and stylize (also using machine learning models trained on artstyles) textures. 
- [June Lite Post-Processing Suite](https://www.github.com/lukasong/junelite) **(shader)**: a lightweight version of June with a fewer features in exchange for a more permissive license.
 <br/><br/>

# 2023 Projects üçï
- [Bokeh Studio](https://github.com/lukasong/projects/tree/main/shader/bokeh) **(shader)**: a real-time bokeh shader for Unity that has many features such as texture-based shapes, edge cleaning, animated shapes, and much more!
- [Realistic & Toon Fire](https://github.com/lukasong/projects/tree/main/shader/fire) **(shader)**: two shaders for Unity that emulate either a realistic flame or an anime-styled fireball.
 <br/><br/>

- [HuggingFace Downloader](https://github.com/lukasong/projects/tree/main/python/huggingface_dl) **(python)**: dont really do python stuff, but learning it on the side, just wanted to avoid the useless information git clone provides and get ML models right from HuggingFace
- [FPSColor Shader](https://github.com/lukasong/projects/tree/main/shader/fpscolor) **(shader)**: smol ezpz shader that calculates fps from shader via deltatime.w and displays a different color based on set limtis
- [Windwaker Dome](https://github.com/lukasong/projects/tree/main/shader/windwaker_dome) **(shader)**: simple shader for spheres that emulates the skybox-ish effect of being underwater in Hyrule in Legend of Zelda Windwaker (for Unity)

# Closed-Source (Public) Projects üçÄ
- [SafeSpace Shader](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/safespace?layout=profile) **(shader)**: a shader for Unity that allows you to create a safe space for yourself in VRChat, removing particles and overlaying shaders from your screenspace, by using a stencil system to erase, capture, and redraw the screen.
- [LookAtMe! Shader](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/lookatme?layout=profile) **(shader)**: a mesh projection shader for Unity with various features like detecting walls and determing eyeline visibility entirely on the GPU
- [Autograph Shader](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/autographshader?layout=profile) **(shader)**: a raymarched 3D font shader with a script that lets you generate custom text using the font with a lot of fun effects
- [Sci-Fi Shader](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/scifishader?layout=profile) **(shader)**: a texture-based tiling shader with a science fiction aesthetic and features like LED screen simulation
- [Necromancer](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/necromancervrc?layout=profile) **(csharp)**: a Unity tool that allows you to control characters, automate cameras, and pose armatures
- [Medicine Shader](https://lukasong.gumroad.com/l/medicineshader?layout=profile) **(shader)**: a raymarched shader that simulates raining medicine capsules (experiment, first time raymarching)
